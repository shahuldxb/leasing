    story: "Each month, the lease liability 'grows' slightly because of the time value of money — the company is effectively borrowing money by deferring payments. IFRS 16 requires this interest to be recognised as a Finance Cost expense each month. The formula is simple: Lease Liability × (Annual IBR ÷ 12). For example, if the liability is QAR 2,000,000 and the IBR is 5%, the monthly interest is QAR 8,333.",

    story: "The Right-of-Use Asset is not an expense all at once — it is 'used up' gradually over the lease term, just like any other asset. Each month, a depreciation charge is recognised on the income statement. For a straight-line lease, this is simply: ROU Asset Value ÷ Total Lease Term (in months). For example, a QAR 2,400,000 ROU asset over 48 months = QAR 50,000 per month depreciation.",

  LEASE_PAYMENT: {
    story: "When the monthly lease payment is made, it is not a single expense — it must be split into two components: (1) the Principal portion, which reduces the Lease Liability on the balance sheet, and (2) the Interest portion, which was already accrued in the previous entry. The cash payment therefore reduces both the liability and the accrued interest. For example, a QAR 50,000 payment might be split as QAR 41,667 principal + QAR 8,333 interest.",

  MODIFICATION: {
    story: "When the terms of a lease change — for example, the monthly rent increases from QAR 50,000 to QAR 55,000, or the lease is extended by 2 years — IFRS 16 requires the company to 'remeasure' the lease. This means recalculating the present value of the new future payments and adjusting both the Lease Liability and the ROU Asset. The difference between the old and new liability is recorded as an adjustment entry.",

  TERMINATION: {
    story: "When a lease ends early or is terminated, both the ROU Asset and the Lease Liability must be removed from the balance sheet ('derecognised'). If the remaining ROU Asset value is higher than the remaining Lease Liability at termination, a loss is recognised. If the liability is higher than the asset, a gain is recognised. This ensures the balance sheet accurately reflects that the company no longer has the right to use the asset.",
    analogy: "It is like selling a car that still has a loan on it. You remove both the car (asset) and the loan (liability) from your books. If the car was worth less than the loan, you record a loss. If worth more, you record a gain.",

  },
  FX_REVALUATION: {
    story: "When a lease is denominated in a foreign currency (e.g. USD), the Lease Liability must be retranslated at the closing exchange rate at each reporting date. If the QAR has strengthened against the USD, the liability in QAR terms decreases — creating a Foreign Exchange Gain. If the QAR has weakened, the liability increases — creating an FX Loss. The ROU Asset is NOT revalued (it stays at the historical rate), so only the liability side is adjusted.",
    analogy: "Imagine you borrowed USD 100,000 when 1 USD = 3.64 QAR (liability = QAR 364,000). At year-end, 1 USD = 3.68 QAR — your liability is now QAR 368,000. You record a QAR 4,000 FX Loss because it now costs more QAR to settle the same USD debt.",

  },
  PERIOD_CLOSE: {
    story: "At the end of each accounting period (month or year), the system posts a combined 'Period-End Close' entry that consolidates both the Interest Accrual and the ROU Depreciation into a single Journal Voucher. This gives the finance team a clean, single entry per period that captures the full P&L impact of all leases — making it easier to review, approve, and post to the general ledger in one step.",
    analogy: "Think of it like a monthly payroll run — instead of posting each employee's salary separately, you run a single batch that captures everyone's pay in one consolidated journal entry. Period-End Close does the same for all lease accounting charges.",
